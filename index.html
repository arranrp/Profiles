                        <p>
                            There is no end of things I'd love to learn &amp; do through the coming year but I've decided to distil it down to six key areas to focus my attention on.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Develope copywriting skills, focusing on micro copy.</li>
                            <li>Find more small events to practice my public speaking. <!--Topics including touch interfaces, RWD design &amp; Communication in the industry.--></li>
                            <li>Work on methods of communicating ideas wether that be to co-workers or clients.</li>

                            <li>Do more physical prototyping. From foam modeling to programming arduinos.</li>
                            <li>Build up to running larger more profesional standard of confernce.</li>
                            <li>Designing for multi screen experience.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I've set my self a lot of work &amp; I have a lot to learn. Fortunitly I know there is so many helpful people in the community who've helped in the past, I'm sure I'll be meeting many more over the comming year.
                            If you can help push me in the right direction or have advice to offer on any of the above I can assure you it will truely be appricated.

                            I worked with Google &amp; Universal to design &amp; build the Robbie Williams google hangout app. User got to play with the artwork of Robbies' latest album via face tracking and some custom tools we put together.

                            In the run christmas Tom Scott &amp; Dan W. Williams had the idea of turning Amazon Lockers into a giant nation wide advent calander. This was really just one of the worlds most elaborate Rick Roll's so I had to support it. This is what some of the winners had to say;

                            It was a small affer, our internet failed us &amp; it was a lot of work. We had some amazing speakers come &amp; deliver great talks, I learnt so much about the web &amp; organising larger events.

                        <p>
                            In the spring of 2011 me &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/danielknell">Daniel Knell</a> had the idea of creating a new new tech event. The goals where simple; Offer something for the best and brightest web developers around, a space to share ideas &amp; stimulate them. Two years later <a href="">London JS</a> has had 42 speakers from all over the world coming to share they knowladge with out community. Somer personal highlights for me have been <a href="">Paul King</a>, <a href="">Irene Ros</a>, <a href="">Addy Osmani</a>, <a href="">Syd Lawrence</a>, <a href="">Mark Wubben</a>, <a href="">Jake Archibald</a> &amp; <a href="">Andrew Betts</a>. I've watch had the pleasure of watching some of our new faces develop into regulers of the confernce curcit. Seen our attendees get inspired to make some wonderful things.

                        <p>
                            I've spent a fair bit of time working at agencies over the years &amp; all my start up friends tell me how dull &amp; corparate that sounds. Sure I've spent time working on marketing emails &amp; sites for finance firms but I've also got to work on some pretty cool projects over the years with some of the best developers &amp; developers I've had the pleasure to meet. Thats ranged from building mobile shopping apps to prototyping apps on the Wii &amp; designing 50 foot touch interfaces. To top it all off I was part of a team tasked with designing a cocktail in two days. It was geeky, it was messy, it was like Mad Men meets the IT Crowd.
