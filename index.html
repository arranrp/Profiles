                        <p>
                            There are countless things I'd love to learn and do this year, but I have decided to focus my attention on six key areas:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Develop copywriting skills, focusing on micro copy.</li>
                            <li>Practice public speaking at more events. <!--Topics including touch interfaces, RWD design &amp; Communication in the industry.--></li>
                            <li>Work on methods of communicating ideas to co-workers and clients.</li>

                            <li>Do more physical prototyping, from foam modelling to programming Arduinos.</li>
                            <li>Work towards organising larger conferences with high professional standards.</li>
                            <li>Design for multi-screen experiences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I have set myself a lot of goals and I have a lot to learn. Fortunately, I know there are so many people in the community who helped me in the past and I'm sure I will meet many more this year. If you can help push me in the right direction or have advice to offer on any of the above, I can assure you it will truly be appreciated.

                            Over the past few years I've had the pleasure of working on some pretty cool projects with equally awesome people. I've written about some of the personal highlights below.

                        <p>
                            I worked with Google and Universal to design and build the Robbie Williams' Google Hangout app. Users got to play with the artwork of Robbie's latest album via face tracking and some custom tools we put together.

                        <p>
                            Before Christmas, Tom Scott &amp; Dan W. Williams had the idea of turning Amazon Lockers into a giant nationwide advent calendar. This was really just one of the world's most elaborate Rick Rolls, so I had to support it. This is what some of the winners said:

                            I had the pleasure of hiring the awesome comedy duo <a href="http://helenarney.com/shows/domestic-science/">Helen Arney &amp; Rob Wells</a> to preform at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geek-lates/">Geek Lates</a> along with a whole host of other amazing presenters and got asked one of the best questions of the year. You can read more about it on Storify, londonist and Lanyrd. <a href="http://storify.com/arranrp/geek-lates">Storify</a>, <a href="http://londonist.com/2012/10/week-in-geek-29-october-4-november-2012.php">londonist</a> and here <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geek-lates/">Lanyrd</a>.

                            It was a small affair, our internet failed us and it was a lot of work. We had some amazing speakers giving great talks, and I learnt a lot about the web and organising larger events.

                            It was far from being Question Time, but I got to talk about subjects I really love and care about, so even if only a handful of people found it useful, that still put a smile on my face.

                        <p>
                            In the spring of 2011, Daniel Knell and I had the idea of creating a new tech event. The goals were simple: offer something for the best and brightest web developers around, and create a space to share and stimulate ideas. Two years later London JS has had 42 speakers from all over the world coming to share their knowledge with our community. Some personal highlights for me have been Paul King, Irene Ros, Addy Osmani, Syd Lawrence, Mark Wubben, Jake Archibald and Andrew Betts. I've had the pleasure of watching some of our new faces develop into regulars of the conference circuit and seen our attendees get inspired to make some wonderful things.

                        <p>
                            I've spent a fair bit of time working at agencies over the years and all my start-up friends tell me how dull and corporate that sounds. Sure, I worked on marketing emails and finance websites, but over the years I also got to work on some pretty cool projects  with some of the best developers. These projects ranged from building mobile shopping apps to prototyping Wii apps and designing 50-foot wide touch interfaces. To top it all off, I was a part of a team tasked with designing a cocktail in two days. It was geeky, it was messy, it was like Mad Men meets the IT Crowd.

                            I'm pretty active on Twitter, although it is pretty inane and subjective. If you'd like a more serious conversation about a project or any other ideas, you can always email me. If you'd just like to see what else I've been up to, then you can see things I'm making on github and events I'm organising on Lanyrd.
