Profiles
=========

Profiles is a simple professional profile made in HTML/CSS. The idea behind it is a result of conversations with [Ian Fenn] and [Jason Mesut]. Their key points could be summarised as follows:
* Standard portfolios only illustrate visual skills and the ability to produce deliverables
* Ideas and methodology come across poorly in this way
* Most portfolios focus on where you have been and what you have made
* What is missing is how you got to the finished product and the results

Profiles attempts to help focus more on the parts that are often missing from standard portfolios. I'm not suggesting this design solves all of the above problems â€“ it's far from complete, and as such I'd appreciate any feedback.

Profiles in use:

If you'd like to use this project for yourself that would be great. If you'd like to use this as a template and change it, then please do. If you do either of these I'd appreciate seeing the results and listing them here.

Tech
-----------

Profiles currently only consists of HTML/CSS with the most minimal amount of Java Script. The CSS is created locally using the preprocessor LESS CSS. I'm looking at implementing either octopress or jekyll for managing content.
