Profiles
=========

Profiles is simple professional profile made in HTML/CSS. The ideas in the design and purpose of Profiles are based on public discussions from [Ian Fenn] and [Jason Mesut].

* Standard portfolios only illustrate visual ability and ability to process deliverables
* Ideas and methodology come across poorly in this way
* Most portfolios focus on where you have been and what you have made
* What is missing is how you got to the finished product and the results

I'm not suggesting this design solves all of the above problems and it's far from complete. As such I'd appreciate any feedback.
Profiles in use:

If you'd like to use this project for your self that would be great. If you'd like to use this as a template and change it please do. If you do either of these I'd appreciate seeing the results and listing them here.

Tech
-----------

Profiles currently only consists of HTML/CSS with the most minimal amount of Java Script. The CSS is created locally using the preprocessor LESS CSS. I'm looking at implementing either octopress or jekyll for managing content.
