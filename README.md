Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's

This text your see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

Tech
-----------

Profiles currently only consists of HTML/CSS with the most minimal amount of Java Script. The CSS is created localy using the preprocessor LESS CSS. I'm looking at implmenting either octopress or jekyll for managing content.
